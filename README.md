He can also seach a wider database to find new books and add them to his books by category.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the project you need an ES5 compliant browser  
To install the project you will need npm, [visit npm page to install it](https://www.npmjs.com/) if needed.
The project is created with create-ract-app so all dependencies will be added.These specific dependencies are:  
- prop-types
- sort-by
- react-router-dom

### Installing
- Clone the repository or download the files
- Go to to the directory where you have cloned or copied the project and run:  
 `npm install`
 The project will install all dependencies requested.
 - run `npm start` to start the application. A web page will open in your browser with the home page of the application. By default the server runs on port 3000.  
 If this port is used on your computer you can change it by setting another port in the package.json file:  
 Linux: `"start": "PORT=XXXX react-scripts start"`  
 Windows: `"start": "set PORT=XXXX && react-scripts start"`  
 where XXXX is the port you want
 ### Usage
 The home page display your books on 3 shelves, each book with, if available, a cover miniature, its title and its author(s).
 User can open a dropdown menu on each book allowing him to change it of shelf (category). The book will then move on the screen to go in the adequate category.  
 He can also view more details about the book by clicking the button at the top of each book. This will navigate him to a detailed page with some more information if available in the database and a link to the Google Books page of the selected book.  
 At the bottom of the page the user can click on a "plus" link wich will open a seach page where he can find new books. Books will appear instantly while he types the query for the search.
